Hello! I'm an enthusiast in DevOps and SRE, focusing on designing and building applications using AWS cloud infrastructure. A big fan of Disney, I value balancing work with personal interests. My expertise lies in using Terraform for IaC (Infrastructure as Code), implementing incremental deployments through GitOps with GitHub Actions.

In backend development, I have experience with C# and Go. For front-end projects, I enjoy working with Next.js as a hobby and develop professionally using ASP.NET.
